# [Tonyhax International](readme.md) -> Save Game Exploit

The original way to boot the Tonyhax International loader is with _a special game save file_ that is placed on a PS1 memory card that you load while playing a [specific, supported authentic PS1 game disc](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list) on your console. 

## Requirements

*   Any supported console.
* A [supported authentic/'black' PSX game disc](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list) that your console can boot normally (i.e. not an 'imported region disc').
* A soft-modded PS2 console capable of [copying files](#ps2-installation-method) from a USB flash drive or other storage to a PS1 memory card. There are [alternative methods](#ps3-memory-card-usb-adapter-method) to copy the required files to a PS1 memory card available (which requires other hardware).
* A PS1 memory card with enough space for the special save game exploit file and for the Tonyhax International loader filed.
* A FAT32 formatted USB flash drive that your PS2 console can read (if using a soft-modded [PS2](#ps2-installation-method) for installation). Please note that not all USB flash drives seem to work with PS2 consoles (due to iffy USB 1.1 support found in some newer USB flash drives). You may need to do a bit of trial and error testing to find a USB flash drive that works.

## Usage

You need to copy the _Tonyhax International Loader_ and _Save Game Exploit_ files specific to your exact exploitable PSX game disc to the PS1 memory card. Then you can load the _Save Game Exploit_ file in a specific way in-game to trigger an exploit that starts the Tonyhax International loader. The exact filenames and disc-specific instructions can be found in the [Save Game Exploit Supported Games List](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list).

There are 2 methods that I personally use to copy the save game exploit files to a PS1 memory card, they are the [Modded PS2 Method](#modded-ps2-method), and the [PS3 Memory Card USB Adaptor Method](#ps3-memory-card-usb-adapter-method). There are other methods that I haven't tried though they would also work. You just need to get the correct files on the PS1 memory card.

## Modded PS2 Method

You can use a PS2 console to copy the save game exploit files to a PS1 memory card from a USB flash drive.

You want to **use the RAW save game exploit file for your exploitable game (in the `entrypoints` directory) and the RAW loader file (in the `loader` directory)** when using this installation method. The RAW filenames are in the [list below](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list).

Installation:

Copy the `Tonyhax International Loader RAW File` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file to the FAT32 USB flash drive using a computer.

![copy Tonyhax International loader file HAX](images/copy-hax-to-usb-drive.png)

![copy save game exploit file of Crash Bandicoot 2 Japan](images/copy-crash-2-japan-save-exploit-to-usb-drive.png)

Eject the USB flash drive from your computer and insert it along with a PS1 memory card into your PS2. 

![Eject USB drive](images/eject-usb-drive.png)

Start the [WLaunchELF](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF) homebrew program on your PS2 console. Navigate to the `mass` device (this is your USB flash drive) with the `DPAD` on the controller, then select it with the `circle` button. 

![scph 10000 wlaunchelf main menu](images/scph-10000-wlaunchelf-main-menu.png)

![wlaunchelf](images/wlaunchelf.png)

![wlaunchelf select mass](images/wlaunchelf-select-mass.png)

Using the `DPAD` to navigate, press the `cross` button on the controller to highlight both the `Tonyhax International Loader RAW` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file that you previously copied to the USB flash drive. Press the `R1` button on the controller to make the file operations menu appear in [WLaunchELF](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF). Use the `DPAD` to move to the copy function and then press the `circle` button to select it.

![wlaunchelf copy crash 2 exploit files](images/wlaunchelf-copy-crash-2-exploit-files.png)

![wlaunchelf copied crash 2 exploit files](images/wlaunchelf-copied-crash-2-exploit-files.png)

Press the `triangle` button to navigate out of the `mass` device. Use the `DPAD` and the circle button to navigate into either the `MC0` (if the PS1 memory card is in slot 1 of the PS2) or `MC1` (if the PS1 memory card is in slot 2 of the PS2) device. 

![wlaunchelf copy to memory card slot 1](images/wlaunchelf-copy-to-memory-card-slot-1.png)

* Press the `R1` button to again make the file operations menu appear in [WLaunchELF](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF). Use the `DPAD` to navigate to the paste option and press the `circle` button to finally paste both the Tonyhax International Loader RAW File` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file. Now you can press the `triangle` button to navigate out of the PS1 memory card device, and remove the memory card from the PS2 console (if you want to use it in a different console).

## PS3 Memory Card USB Adapter Method

You can use a PS3 Memory Card adapter in combination with the [MemcardRex](https://github.com/ShendoXT/memcardrex) and a Windows PC to copy the save game exploit files to a PS1 memory card.

Get the latest version of [MemcardRex](https://github.com/ShendoXT/memcardrex) and follow the instructions to install the driver for the PS3 Memory card adapter. Those instructions are found in the previous link, as well as copied verbatim below:

`PS3 Memory Card Adaptor
The PS3 Memory Card Adaptor is an official Sony USB adapter that allows reading and writing PS1 Memory Cards on a PlayStation 3.
To use it on a Windows PC, a custom USB driver needs to be installed.`

`This USB driver can be easily created and installed using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) by following these steps:`

`Plug the PS3 Memory Card Adaptor into a free USB port and start Zadig.
Zadig should display the PS3 MCA as an "Unknown Device". Verify that the USB ID matches: 054C 02EA`

`Click the Edit checkbox and name the device "PS3 Memory Card Adaptor"
Ensure that "WinUSB" is selected from the list of Driver options and click the Install Driver button.`

`After about 30 seconds Zadig should show a message that the driver was installed successfully.`

`With the USB driver installed and the PS3 Memory Card Adaptor plugged in, you should now be able to read, write and format PS1 Memory Cards.`

With everything ready, start up memcardrex and start copying/writing the save game exploit files, as displayed in the following images:

You want to **use the MCS save game exploit file for your exploitable game (in the `entrypoints` directory) and the MCS loader file  (in the `loader` directory)** when using this installation method. The MCS filenames are in the list below.

## Save Game Exploit Supported Games List

_Notes:_ 

* Demo versions of games do not contain load/save game functions and are hence not exploitable.

* Some games have multiple different versions of the same regional release (Rev 0, Rev 1, etc.). Sometimes, one save game exploit file won't work on both versions and multiple different save game exploit files are required. Some specific game/version combinations also do not have a save game exploit file available yet, this is a work in progress. Please see each listing below to see if this is the case for your specific PSX game disc that is a supported title.

* If you are using a Japanese PSX, it is **highly recommended** that you power off the console, put in the Japanese PSX game disc that has a save game exploit file available, block the lid sensor, and then turn on the console to boot the game disc. This makes it faster to swap out the disc once the Tonyhax International loader starts. 

* The _Exploit Instructions_ in each game listing below explain the game specific steps to trigger the exploit which starts the Tonyhax International loader.

* The _Save Game Exploit_ file can be on a memory card inserted in slot 1 or slot 2 of your console as long as the game supports loading a save game file from slot 2, it should work. Otherwise the _Save Game Exploit_ file **must be on the memory card in slot 1 of the console.**

* The _Tonyhax International Loader_ file **must be on a memory card inserted in slot 1** of your console.

### Final Fantasy IX (Disc 1)

_Note 1:_ Final Fantasy IX has 2 different types of exploits. Exploit type A works on consoles with BIOS versions 1.0-2.0. Exploit type B works on all newer BIOS versions (v2.1 to 5.0). 

_Note 2:_ If you have the Final Fantasy IX save exploit on a memory card and use the memory card manager of a SCPH-1000 console the entire console will lock up. This only happens when using the SCPH-1000's memory card manager, so please avoid doing that :) If you delete the Final Fantasy IX save exploit file this will stop the console from locking up with the default memory card manager of the SCPH-1000.

_Note 3:_ If you have the Final Fantasy IX save exploit on a memory card and use the memory card manager of a SCPH-3000 or newer the filenames of every save displayed will be bugged. This is visual only and doesn't affect any functionality.

Consoles with BIOS v1.0-v2.0:

* All SCPH-1000s.
* Very early SCPH-3000s, SCPH-1001s, and SCPH-1002s (the ones susceptible to the [CD Player Swap Trick](#cd-player-swap-trick)).

Consoles with BIOS v2.1-v5.0:

* Late SCPH-3000s, SCPH-1001s, SCPH-1002s, and **all newer models** (including PS2s) need to use the type B exploit for Final Fantasy IX.
