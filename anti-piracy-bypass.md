# Anti-Piracy Bypass System

## Background Info

Starting in late 1998, some specific PSX games began implementing additional copy protection designed to prevent playing backup CD-R copies of a game. Different types of additional copy protection have been found in PSX games over the years.

## APv1

The very first kind of 'standardized' additional copy protection that appeared in later PSX games. The _APv1 style protection can only prevent a backup CD-R of a game from working on a console that has a 'non-stealth mod-chip' installed_. APv1 style protection **can not detect games booted with Tonyhax International** on a stock console without a _non-stealth_ mod-chip. This means that all games with this protection work already with Tonyhax International.

## APv2

Unlike APv1, APv2 does trigger when games are booted with Tonyhax International on a stock console **unless a game disc specific [APv2 Bypass](#apv2-bypasses) has been implemented for it in the Tonyhax International loader**. The good news is at this point almost all if not every single game with this protection now has a working bypass implemented.

The very early SCPH-3000 Japanese consoles, and all SCPH-1000 Japanese consoles are immune to tripping APv2 as long as they are stock and not containing a 'non-stealth' mod-chip. These consoles will work with every game without a bypass even being needed. In fact, Tonyhax International does not even apply the APv2 bypasses for these consoles when they are detected.

## What Happens When Additional Anti-Piracy Protection Is Triggered

![spyro year of the dragon usa rev 0 apv2 triggered](images/spyro-year-of-the-dragon-usa-rev-0-non-stealth-mod-chip-apv2-triggered.png)

When triggered, the APv1 and APv2 style copy protections will trigger an 'anti-piracy screen of death'. If you encounter an APv2 game that triggers this screen, then the specific game disc is not yet supported (this is a work in progress). In such a case please open an [Anti-Piracy issue](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/issues/new?assignees=&labels=antipiracy&template=antipiracy-issue.md&title=) on the [Tonyhax International Github](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax) to let me know about this specific game which contains APv2 protection. I would eventually like every game that can trigger the anti-piracy copy protection routine when booted via Tonyhax International on a stock console to have a  bypass implemented for 100% compatibility.

## EDC

In addition to [APv1](#apv1) or [APv2](#apv2) protection, [most Dance Dance Revolution PSX games](#edc-protected-psx-games) contain an EDC-based protection measure. For the affected games, this protection is triggered when you burn the EDC protected PSX CD image with standard CD burning software, which in most cases will changes the EDC data when burning an EDC protected PSX CD image.

### PSX EDC Anti-Piracy Protection

The idea of EDC/EEC based additional anti-piracy protection is a brilliantly flawed one. See, Sony's tools to generate disc images back in the day were [buggy](http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1475). One such bug appears to be that the [reserved sectors 12-15](http://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm#cdromisovolumedescriptors), which are zero filled in the user data portion of the sector, _also_ **have an EDC checksum of zero**. The correct checksum for a zero-filled user data sector _should be_ `3F 13 B0 BE`, _but it isn't_. It's `00 00 00 00` like the rest of the sector besides the sync data. This actually doesn't matter in practice, so the bug went unoticed and the technically invalid sector 12-15s shipped on real licensed PSX CD-ROMs. This apparently got fixed eventually in some newer version of the `cdgen` Sony tool that created disc images.

Someone working on the Dance Dance Revolution PSX games noticed this strange behavior and figured out that it could be exploited as an additional anti-piracy protection measure. If the real licensed PSX CD-ROM discs were shipped with an EDC checksum of zero in sector 12-15, then when someone went to rip the real licensed PSX CD-ROM disc and then burn it back to a CD-R, the EDC checksum in sector 12-15 would no longer be `00 00 00 00`, it would be the expected `3F 13 B0 BE`. [Game code](https://github.com/socram8888/tonyhax/issues/121#issuecomment-1341381549) can read the EDC checksum on the disc at sector 12, and a routine could then lock up the game if the EDC data is non-zero to deter piracy.

### Burning EDC Protected PSX Games Correctly

I recommend using the latest CDRDAO v1.2.5 which unlike previous versions supports burning EDC Protected PSX games with CD audio tracks correctly using the `generic-mmc-raw` driver. There are pre-built portable releases of a new enough CDRDAO for Linux [available](https://alex-free.github.io/cdrdao).

**Run [edcre](https://alex-free.github.io/edcre) on the first data track bin file of the disc image before burning with the CDRDAO RAW driver** as described below.

`cdrdao write --speed 1 --driver generic-mmc-raw --swap -n --eject yourgame.cue`

![Burning Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Remix Japan](images/ddr2j-burning.png)

### CDRDAO Command Explanation

The `--speed 1` argument sets the writing speed to the slowest your CD burner supports.

The `--driver generic-mmc-raw` arguments specifies CDRDAO to use the `generic-mmc-raw` driver, which burns the CD image exactly as it is. The default driver used without specifiying these arguments is the **`generic-mmc` driver, which like the other drivers in CDRDAO will auto-regenerate EDC data as the CD image is burned.** This can change the EDC data read from the burned disc later, which some PSX games use as an additional anti-piracy check which if failed will lock up [the game](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#games-with-edc-protection).

The `--swap` argument is neccesary if the BIN/CUE CD image contains CD audio. Without it, you will get loud static when the CD audio tracks are played as they are by default byte-swapped by CDRDAO if this argument is not specified.

The `-n` argument disables the 10 second waiting period before burning.

The `--eject` argument will automatically eject the disc immediately after a successful burn.

### EDC Protected PSX Games

Every Dance Dance Revolution PSX game has EDC protection with the exception of the game [Dance Dance Revolution: Disney's Rave](http://redump.org/disc/37012/) / [Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Mix](http://redump.org/disc/13669/).

 Almost every Dance Dance Revolution PSX game containing EDC protection also have either [APv2](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#apv2) or [APv1](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#apv1) based anti-piracy detection code. [Tonyhax International](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international) has [APv2 Bypasses](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#apv2-bypasses) implemented for all the known EDC protected games to ensure they run on stock consoles [when burned correctly](#burning-edc-protected-psx-games-correctly).

## LibCrypt

Some PAL PSX games are using a different copy protection scheme known as LibCrypt protection. Similar to EDC protection, LibCrypt protection is triggered when you burn a LibCrypt protected PSX CD image with standard CD burning software, which in most cases changes the SubChannel data when burning such a protected PSX CD image.

LibCrypt protection can be bypassed by burning a backup CD-R of a LibCrypt game using [CloneCD](#clone-cd) in a very [specific](https://github.com/Kippykip/SBITools) way.

Real PAL LibCrypt discs booted via Tonyhax International on USA or Japanese consoles ('imports') will not trip the detection.

## CD Burning

### [CDRDAO-PLED](https://alex-free.github.io/cdrdao)

* Is Open Source?: Yes. Pre-built Linux x86_64 binaries are also [available](https://alex-free.github.io/cdrdao##downloads).
* Burns Standard PSX Backup CD-Rs?: Yes. For .bin/.cue CD images, the `--swap` argument is required.
* Burns PSX Backup CD-Rs With Additional EDC Protection Correctly?: Yes, After running [EDCRE](https://alex-free.github.io/edcre) use the `--swap` and  `--driver generic-mmc-raw` arguments.
* Burns PSX Backup CD-Rs With LibCrypt Protection Correctly?: CDRDAO can rip an authentic PAL PSX game disc containing LibCrypt protection correctly into a .toc/.bin CD image file. This file can be burned back by using the `generic-mmc-raw` driver. The much more common .bin/.cue/.sub CD image LibCrypt rips do not work directly however.

### [CloneCD](https://www.redfox.bz/en/clonecd.html)

* Is Open Source?: No, it is Windows only FreeWare with a free 'demo' version as well as a full paid version. The 'demo' version can be used however for PSX Backup CD-R burning without limitation.
* Burns Standard PSX Backup CD-Rs?: Yes, no special options required.
* Burns PSX Backup CD-Rs With Additional EDC Protection Correctly?: Yes, After running [EDCRE](https://alex-free.github.io/edcre) use [RAW](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?PHPSESSID=3voij6gqs993vdbd15mlmc2k7h&topic=42415.msg371328##msg371328) mode.
