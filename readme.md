# Tonyhax International: The Ultimate Backup CD-R/Import Disc Loader Soft-Mod Solution For The Original PlayStation & Early Models Of PlayStation 2

_Brought to you by [Alex Free](http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6018), [MottZilla](http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=867), [Patchouli (karehaani)](http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6714), and [SylverReZ (M4x1mumReZ)](https://gbatemp.net/members/sylverrez.610331/). Built on the work of many [others](credits.md)._

Tonyhax International is a fork of the [Tonyhax](https://orca.pet/tonyhax/) "Software backup loader exploit thing for the Sony PlayStation 1" originally created by [Socram8888](https://github.com/socram8888).  Developed by Alex Free and MottZilla with many new features and upgrades compared to the original Tonyhax, some of which are listed below:

* Supports all PS1 Consoles (Japanese, American, European, SCPH-1000-SCPH-102) **and** Early PS2 Consoles (Japanese, American, European, SCPH-10000-SCPH-39004).

*   Supports formating [FreePSXBoot](freepsxboot-exploit.md) memory cards correctly, removing the exploit if desired and allowing normal game saves to work again.

* Supports starting the Tonyhax International loader with [GameShark Codes](gameshark-code.md) and any PSX cheat device using the new GameSharkHAX boot method.

* Supports [flashing](flashed-cheat-cart.md) the Tonyhax International loader to a GameShark, Action Reply, or similar PSX cheat cartridge. Whenever the flashed cartridge is plugged into the back of a PSX console model with a cartridge port on the back when you power it on the Tonyhax International will boot instead of the shell program/BIOS (Sony screens/CD Player/Memory Card Manager). You can still however access the CD Player/Memory Card Manager by powering on the console with the CD drive open, and then pressing `X` when prompted in the Tonyhax International loader.

* Starts the Tonyhax International loader faster using ps1-packer decompression techniques. This also makes it smaller in size.

* Supports **more [save game exploits](save-game-exploit.md)**, enabling the use of even more PSX game discs to start the Tonyhax International loader.

* Boots more games via the [FreePSXBoot](freepsxboot-exploit.md) exploit successfully.

* Supports more [games with additional copy protection routines](anti-piracy-bypass.md), by **using a completely different anti-piracy bypass system.**

* Supports [applying user-supplied GameShark codes](gameshark-code-support.md) to any game it booted by the Tonyhax International loader. Dare I say this is the world's first open source PSX GameShark.

* Supports [TOCPerfect Patching](https://alex-free.github.io/tocperfect) a CD image directly to use the Tonyhax International loader as a way to remove some of the limitations of using the CD Player Swap Trick as a boot method, or to make a 'protected non-stealth mod-chip console compatible patched CD-R' that directly boots without needing to go through any other boot method.

* Enables speeding up xStation boot time and allows for applying codes to games `Full Boot`ed by xStation. This is accomplished by a [special xStation ROM version](xstation.md).

* Uses a different [build system](build.md) compatible with the `mipsel-none-elf` toolchain and more operating systems.

## Downloads

### Version 1.5.0 (5/28/2024)

*   [tonyhax-international-v1.5.0](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/releases/download/v1.5.0i/tonyhax-international-v1.5.0.zip)

----------------------------------

Changes:

*   Fixed booting discs with FreePSXBoot exploited memory cards. The latest FreePSXBoot builder commit has a bug that interferes with Tonyhax International booting games, so I have reverted back to my [last commit](https://github.com/alex-free/FreePSXBoot/commit/9aacebc554b37867936a5d067269113e7ea3b296) in my fork which has no downsides other then it works correctly.

*   Began implementing [EDC](anti-piracy-bypass.md#edc) bypasses for games. Dance Dance Revolution (Japan) now has an EDC bypass and can be burned by any burning software. For games which don't yet have EDC bypasses you still need to burn them in RAW DAO mode to bypass the EDC check in the protected game. Please see the [anti-piracy bypass list](anti-piracy-bypass.md#list-of-protected-psx-game-discs) for compatibility.

*   Included `entry-bb.bin` and `entry.bin` in releases.

The Tonyhax International loader is the program that once started enables the use of backup CD-Rs or import PS1 discs. The Tonyhax International loader can be booted with a [flashed cheat cart](flashed-cheat-cart.md), a [flashed memory card](freepsxboot-exploit.md), a [save game exploit](save-game-exploit.md), a [CD-R](boot-cd.md), or even a [GameShark Code](gameshark-code.md). The Tonyhax International loader provides the ability to properly play backup CD-R and 'imported region discs' on all PS1 consoles, and all supported early PS2 consoles (Japanese, USA, and PAL models SCPH-10000-SCPH-39004).

If you are **using any Japanese console, at least one real Japanese NTSC-J PS1 game disc is required (any officially licensed Japanese PS1 disc will do)**. If you are **using a Japanese PS2 console (SCPH-10000-SCPH-39000) a Swap Magic Tool is also required**. Neither of these are needed if you are using any American or European PS1 or PS2 console.

### Japanese PS1 Console Loader Instructions

Start the Tonyhax International loader with a supported boot method:

*   [TOCPerfect Patching](https://alex-free.github.io/tocperfect)
*   [GameShark Code](gameshark-code.md)
*   [ROM/ROM Flasher CD](flashed-cheat-cart.md)
*   [FreePSXBoot Memory Card Images](freepsxboot-exploit.md)
*   [Boot CD](boot-cd.md)
*   [Save Game Exploit](save-game-exploit.md)

If you see the text `Put in a real NTSC-J PSX game disc, then block the lid sensor`:

*   Open the CD drive of your PS1 console.
*   Put in a real NTSC-J Japanese PS1 game disc in the CD drive, but don't close the CD drive lid.
*   The lid sensor is highlighted by the red circle and arrow in the pictures below. On the original grey fat PS1 consoles (SCPH-900X and earlier) it is located in the top right corner, it is is shaped like a circle. Ideally you press it down with a bent pen spring as shown. On the slim PSone consoles (SCPH-10X) it is in the lower right corner to the side of the edge of the CD drive. For these consoles it is best to use a piece of tape or paper to slide in and press it down as shown.

![ps1 lid sensor](images/ps1-lid-sensor.jpg)

![ps1 lid sensor blocked front](images/ps1-lid-sensor-blocked-front.jpg)

![ps1 lid sensor blocked side](images/ps1-lid-sensor-blocked-side.jpg)

![psone lid sensor](images/psone-lid-sensor.jpg)

![psone lid sensor blocked](images/psone-lid-sensor-blocked.jpg)

After blocking the lid sensor, your real Japanese PS1 game will spin up and then stop. Once you see the text `Put in a backup/import disc, then press X` remove either the real NTSC-J PSX game disc or Boot CD from your PS1 console's CD drive. 

![scph 1000 rom 1](images/scph-1000-rom-loader-1.png)

![scph 1000 rom 2](images/scph-1000-rom-loader-2.png)

Put in the backup CD-R or import PSX game disc you want to play **without unblocking the lid sensor**. Once you press X, the console will run some commands automatically, followed by the game booting with perfect CD audio playback. Note that you can not unblock the lid sensor while playing the game on **Japanese consoles**, if you do so the game will stop working.

![scph 1000 booting backup](images/scph-1000-loader-rom-booting-duke-nukem-total-meltdown-usa.png)

### Japanese PS2 Console Loader Instructions

Start the Tonyhax International loader with a supported boot method:

*   [Boot CD](boot-cd.md) (I don't know of anyway to boot this on an unmodified Japanese PS2 but it is available).
*   [Save game exploit](save-game-exploit.md)
*   [GameShark Code](gameshark-code.md)

Japanese PS2 consoles **must have the DVD drive tray front panel removed to use Tonyhax International**. For the SCPH-10000, you can follow the method below (some newer consoles may slightly differ in the way to remove the DVD drive's front panel).

### Removing The DVD Drive Tray Front Panel

Turn on the Japanese PS2 console. Eject the DVD drive tray, and **while it is open** power off the console by either pulling the plug from the wall or PSU in the back of the console, or by flicking the power switch for the PSU on the back of the console. You can not use the power button because then the DVD drive tray will close before the console turns off. Now, flip the Japanese PS2 console upside down like in the image below:

![ps2 upside down](images/ps2-upside-down.jpg)

Now bring your focus to the bottom of the opened DVD drive tray. At the very top edge (highlighted in the picture above) is a tab. You want to jam a thin flat head screwdriver in between this tab and the DVD drive tray face plate as shown in the image below. Now, push with the flat head screwdriver to separate the DVD drive face plate from the rest of the DVD drive tray. **Be very gentle and only use a direct straight force towards the face plate. Do not go side to side when doing this or you risk breaking off an edge of the DVD drive tray. I am obviously not responsible for any damage you may do by doing this!** Once successful, the face plate will become removable. You are free to slide it back on at a later time, it just needs to be off for you to use the Japanese PS2 to boot backup/import PS1 games with Tonyhax International.

![ps2 drive tab](images/ps2-drive-tab.jpg)

With the DVD drive face plate off, flip over the Japanese PS2 console right side up. You can now see a gap at the bottom of the DVD drive. This is where you place the Swap Magic Tool in when using Tonyhax International on your Japanese PS2 console.

![ps2 drive cover removed](images/ps2-drive-cover-removed.jpg)

You can now use one of the supported boot methods to start the Tonyhax International loader on the Japanese PS2 console. You will most likely be using the [Save Game Exploit](save-game-exploit.md), however you could be using some kind of intermediate boot disc to boot the [Boot CD](boot-cd.md) as well if you find one that supports Japanese PS1 consoles. Once you see the text `Put in a backup/import disc, then press X` appear, you need to use a Swap Magic Slide Tool to release the DVD drive to gain access to it without pressing the eject switch. A [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffv5m52zlEI) is available that shows how to use the Swap Magic Tool (in general), although the exact steps are also explained below. Once you use the Swap Magic Tool to swap in your import/backup CD-R while booted in the Tonyhax International loader, just press the cross button on your PS2 or PS1 controller to boot and play your game.

![scph-10000 ff9 exploit loader 1](images/scph-10000-ff9-exploit-loader-1.png)

Important note: **do not eject the PS1 import or backup CD-R from the Japanese PS2 console until your done playing the game**. Unlike American and European consoles (which do not have this limitation), if you do so your game will stop working, and you will have to start Tonyhax International all over again to boot your import/backup CD-R and start playing again.

### Using the Swap Magic Tool

Slide in the Swap Magic Tool like shown in the image below by the arrow. You need to feel around with the Swap Magic Tool to get the hook to latch on internally inside the DVD drive.

![ps2 insert slide tool](images/ps2-insert-slide-tool.jpg)

Now that your Swap Magic Tool is latched on internally inside the DVD drive, move it straight to the right side. This movement will feel correct and nice when you are properly using the Swap Magic Tool, reassuring you are using it correctly. Once you get to the end of this movement the DVD drive tray will begin to move forward out of the DVD drive, "releasing" it from it's locked state.

![ps2 slide tool inserted first slide](images/ps2-slide-tool-inserted-first-slide.jpg)

![ps2 slide tool moved to release drive](images/ps2-slide-tool-moved-to-release-drive.jpg)

Use your hand to pull out the DVD drive tray to gain access to the disc in it. Remove the original NTSC-J PSX game disc, and put in your import/backup CD-R.

![ps2 drive released](images/ps2-drive-released.jpg)

With your import/backup CD-R in the Japanese PS2 console, use your hand to push in the DVD drive tray as far as it will go back into the DVD drive.

![ps2 push in released drive](images/ps2-push-in-released-drive.jpg)

Now that the DVD drive tray is pushed all the way back in, the Swap Magic Tool can be used to "lock" the drive. Like before, slide in the Swap Magic Tool to the right most position like shown in the image below. Remember to feel around with the Swap Magic Tool to get the hook to latch on internally inside the DVD drive. Now that your Swap Magic Tool is once again latched on internally inside the DVD drive, move it straight to the left side. This movement will feel correct and nice when you are properly using the Swap Magic Tool, reassuring you are using it correctly. Once you get to the end of this movement (when you can't go any more to the left) the DVD drive tray will fully go back inside the DVD drive to put the DVD drive into the "locked" state. **You must ensure that the DVD drive is fully back in or Tonyhax International will lock up loading the disc**.

![ps2 slide tool moved to lock drive](images/ps2-slide-tool-moved-to-lock-drive.jpg)

## American/European PS1/PS2 Console Loader Instructions

Start the Tonyhax International loader with a supported boot method.

Available boot methods for American and European PS2 consoles:

*   [Boot CD](boot-cd.md).
*   [Save game exploit](save-game-exploit.md)
*   [GameShark Code](gameshark-code.md)

Available boot methods for American and European PS1 consoles:

*   [TOCPerfect Patching](https://alex-free.github.io/tocperfect)
*   [GameShark Code](gameshark-code.md)
*   [ROM Flasher CD](flashed-cheat-cart.md)
*   [FreePSXBoot Memory Card Images](#freepsxboot-memory-card-images)
*   [Boot CD](boot-cd.md)
*   [Save Game Exploit](save-game-exploit.md)

Once you see the text `Put in a backup/import disc` appear, eject the DVD drive (PS2) or open the CD drive (PS1).

*   If you are booting the Tonyhax International [Boot CD](boot-cd.md), you'll want to remove the spring or whatever you have blocking down the lid sensor to "open" the CD drive and stop the disc from spinning, allowing you to remove the Boot CD from the console's CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2).
*   If you are booting Tonyhax International via a [Save Game Exploit](save-game-exploit.md), after ejecting the DVD drive (PS2) or opening the CD drive (PS1) the real PS1 game disc you used with a save game exploit will stop spinning, allowing you to remove it from the console's CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2).

All other boot methods don't have a disc usually in the drive already, so there is no disc to remove. With no disc currently in your console, you can now put in the backup CD-R or import PSX game disc you want to play. Close the CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2). The console will detect that the drive has been closed and will spin up your disc. The console will then send some commands and boot the disc.

## F.A.Q.

### Q: Does the type of CD-R I am using matter?
A: Yes, and so does the burner you use. I have wrote about my findings and put together [The Ultimate Guide To PSX CD-Rs](https://alex-free.github.io/psx-cdr).

### Q: My game doesn't boot or it locks up?
A: This is probably a disc read issue. Ensure you are using high quality CD-Rs and a good burner. If that doesn't help, you may need to [refurbish](https://alex-free.github.io/unofficial-ps1-cd-drive-service-manual/) your console. If all of that doesn't help, maybe there is an issue in International. Please open a [generic issue](https://alex-free.github.io/unofficial-ps1-cd-drive-service-manual/).

### Q: My game's FMVs or audio is stuttering or locking up?
A: This is almost certainly a disc read issue, please see the above answer.

### Q: Can I use International to play protected games, and will it turn my non-stealth mod-chip into a stealth mod-chip?
A: Yes, International automatically detects protected games and applies a bypass to enable play. Each game is supported on a game by game basis, and there is a [list](anti-piracy-bypass.md#protected-games-support). If you know of a protected game that isn't on the list, or isn't working in some situation, please open an [anti-piracy issue](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/issues/new?assignees=&labels=antipiracy&projects=&template=antipiracy-issue.md&title=) and tell me all about it.

### Q: Can I Use International To Play LibCrypt protected games?
A: Yes, but currently you must rip the disc image, patch it with the [LibCrypt Patcher](https://alex-free.github.io/libcrypt-patcher), and burn it to a CD-R. Real LibCrypt discs may still trip non-stealth mod-chip detection.

### Q: Can I Use International To Play EDC protected games?
A: Yes, but currently you must burn the disc image in a [specific way](anti-piracy-bypass.md#edc).

### Q: Can I play games that span multiple discs (i.e. Fear Effect) / have disc change features?
A: If you have any USA or PAL console, yes. The Japanese consoles can not currently support this in the same way. However many multi-disc games may allow you to save before you need to disc swap. So then you can reset the console, restart International, boot disc 2, and then load the save from disc 2. Games that don't have such a save file work around include Parasite Eve, Chrono Chross, and Fear Effect. Let me know if you have found other games like this. 

If you really must play a multi-disc game on your Japanese console, **you can perform a mid-game hot-swap-trick but I highly don't recommend doing this since you risk damaging the psx and your discs.** A proper software-based seamless workaround is planned for the Japanese consoles.

PS1 Mid-Game Hot-Swap-Trick:

*   When the game asks you to insert disc 2, unblock the lid sensor and remove the CD.
*   Put **any real authentic Japanese PSX disc** into the PS1 drive.
*   You will now be performing a _mid-game hot-swap trick_. Have the disc 2 you want to play in one hand, and whatever your using to block the lid sensor in another. Now block the lid sensor, freeing your one hand. Wait until the original real Japanese PSX disc stats spinning fast (~3 seconds) and **immediately** swap the disc with your free hand, and put in the actual disc 2 you want to play. You can now continue playing your game that spans multiple discs normally! This trick would work for games that span even more then 2 discs as well.

PS2 Mid-Game Hot-Swap Trick

This [swap trick method](https://consolecopyworld.com/ps2/ps2swap/lesson1.shtml) probably will suffice but I haven't tried it nor am I interested in it since again the goal is to implement a software-based approach to workaround this issue for all Japanese consoles.

### Q: Why not combine Tonyhax and Tonyhax International into one project?
A: Socram8888 does not own a Japanese console, nor is he interested in getting one. While Socram888 and I do work together to fix issues that effect both the original Tonyhax and Tonyhax International, we have different goals in regards to what the project should support so it makes the most sense to keep these 2 projects separate.

### Q: Why Can't Tonyhax/Tonyhax International Change The Video Mode From PAL to NTSC or vice versa on PS2s?
A: The early PS2 models that Tonyhax International supports do not have the ability to change the video mode from within PS1 mode from what we understand. 

You can change the video mode first while in PS2 mode however. For now you can resort to the **PS2 homebrew software known as [PSVModeNeg](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/ps1vmodeneg-by-sp193.25050/)**, this software allows you to explicitly change the video mode. An older version of PSVModeNeg is required if you want to use it's effects with Tonyhax International, specifically [v1.0.1](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/PS1VModeNeg-1.0.1.zip). This version simply inverses the current video mode of the console, rather then reading the PS1 game disc to figure out what video mode the disc itself expects (which is problematic when using the save game exploit since that disc must match your console's region). Here are the steps below to accomplish this:

*   Download [PSVModeNeg v1.0.1](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/PS1VModeNeg-1.0.1.zip) and extract the file `PS1VModeNeg.elf`.

*   Copy the file `PS1VModeNeg.elf` to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive that works with your soft-modded PS2. You can soft-mod your PS2 with [FreeHDBoot](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5208), [FreeDVDBoot](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot) or [FreeMCBoot](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1248) to be able to use PS1VModeNEG on your PS2 console.

*   Using wLaunchELF load the `PS1VModeNeg.elf` file from the `mass` device (your flash drive).

*   Put in the real PSX game disc that you are using with a [save game exploit](save-game-exploit.md) when in PS1VModeNeg. The video mode will be forced to the inverse of the native one your console runs in.

*   Playing through your real PSX game disc may look or act weird in the changed video mode, ignore this. Just get to the exploit method and start Tonyhax International. Put in the import disc or backup CD-R and the PS1 game will boot at last.

### Q. How Can I Help?
A. If you know C/MIPS assembly and can improve any of the code in International, open a [pull request](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/pulls) with your changes. 

If you don't have programming experience something else that you could help out with is bring to my attention any protected games that are not yet supported in an [anti-piracy issue](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/issues/new?assignees=&labels=antipiracy&projects=&template=antipiracy-issue.md&title=).
