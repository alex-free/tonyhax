## MottZilla

*   Help with the custom anti-piracy bypasses for Koneko mo Issho and i-mode mo Issho: Doko Demo Issho Tsuika Disc.

*   Co-developed the 'fake PAL BIOS bypass' method for APv2 bypasses.

*	Guidance on increasing the size of the Tonyhax International loader and my general goto mentor on this project.

* Co-developed the Spyro Year Of The Dragon GameShark code bypass method.

*	Wrote the GameShark Code Engine, used first in the APv2 bypass system. With MottZilla's guidance this code has even been expanded and adapted for general use [GameShark Code Support](gameshark-code.md).

*   The original sole creator of [PS1 DemoSwap Patcher v1.0](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/mctool-tonyhax-freepsxboot-installer.36569). MottZilla re-implemented the TOCPerfect concept into a much superior method, and included his implementation alongside of his DemoSwap idea in PS1 DemoSwap Patcher.

*   Wrote the controller input support for Tonyhax International.

*   Wrote the laser re-calibration function for VC2 and VC3 CDROM controllers.

*   Developed the first Japanese save game exploit for Crash Bandicoot 2.

*   Developed the PS-EXE loader used on GameShark/cheat cartridges to run Tonyhax International.

*   Came up with reset+unlock technique for TOCPerfect booting on USA/PAL consoles.

*   Originally came up with the idea to involve the SetSession 2 command in a fix for the older CDROM controllers which resulted in the eventual discovery of the SetSessionSuperUltraCommandSmash v2.

*   Explained the save game checksum routines in both Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 (Japanese version) & Castrol Honda VTR (Japanese version) to help me create SuccessCheckSumUpdater (SuccessCU).

*   Explained to myself how to find/port save game exploits to new games or to different versions of games available in different regions (i.e. Japanese version).

## Patchouli(karehaani)

*   Doki Oki (Japan) save game exploit.

*   Crash Bandicoot 3 (Japan) save game exploit.

*   The Lengend Of Heroes I&II (Japan) save game exploit.

*   Tekken 3 Japan/USA/PAL save game exploits (based off of previous work by [krystalgamer](https://github.com/socram8888/tonyhax/pull/20)).

*   Tekken 2 Japan (rev 1 only)/USA (rev 0 only)/PAL save game exploits (based off of previous work by [krystalgamer](https://github.com/socram8888/tonyhax/pull/20)).

*   Downhill Snow (Japan) save game exploit.

*   Final Fantasy IX (Japan and USA) save game exploit.

## SylverReZ (M4x1mumReZ)

*   Helping with debugging an [APrip](https://alex-free.github.io/aprip) issue on Windows.

*   Generated Aprip codes for APv2 bypasses for i-mode mo Issho: Doko Demo Issho Tsuika Disc, Koko Hore! Pukka, Love Hina: Ai wa Kotoba no Naka ni / Love Hina 2: Kotoba wa Konayuki no You ni, Pocket Jiman.

## Nicholas Noble

*   Wrote PS1 Packer and released it as an easy to use [submodule](https://github.com/pcsx-redux/support). Helped implement it for the memory card boot methods.

*   Corrected the CD_REGS value in `loader/cdrom.c` to use the right memory region.

*   Came up with the best `cdrom:\\` text stripper for `CdGetLbn()` in `loader/secondary.c`

## Misc Acknowledgements

*   [Berion](https://www.psx-place.com/members/berion.1431/) of [PSX-Place](https://psx-place.com) compressed the images of this document properly (this is the first time I've edited photos).

*   Martin Korth for confirming the SetSession bug found in VC0A, VC0B, and VC1A CDROM controller BIOS versions, and for the priceless [PSX-SPX](http://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm) document.

*   [Peppe90](https://www.psx-place.com/members/peppe90.42412/) of [PSX-Place](https://psx-place.com) for testing NTSC gamems on a PAL PS2. His results have confirmed that the video mode can not be changed from PS1 software in PS1 mode on a PS1. It must be changed in PS1DRV from the PS2, as PS1 mode is set to always display the same video mode that the console shipped with (for the early PS2s that Tonyhax International supports). He mentioned that PS1VModeNeg v1.0.1 can be used to overcome this. The original Tonyhax [issue](https://github.com/socram8888/tonyhax/issues/25) explaining this also was helpful in figuring out how to bypass this PS2 level limitation.
