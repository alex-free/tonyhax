# Anti-Piracy Bypass System

## Background Info

Starting in late 1998, some specific PSX games began implementing additional copy protection designed to prevent playing backup CD-R copies of a game. Different types of additional copy protection have been found in PSX games over the years. Tonyhax International supports such games on a game by game basis, with a goal of finding and adding the ability to play all such games eventually.

## [Full Supported Protected Games List](#protected-games-support)

## Types Of Protection

*   [APv1](#apv1) - only effects non-stealth mod-chip consoles.
*   [APv2](#apv2) - effects both non-stealth mod-chip consoles and stock, unmodified consoles.
*   [EDC](#edc).
*   [LibCrypt](#libcrypt).

## APv1

The very first kind of 'standardized' additional copy protection that appeared in later PSX games. This is only found in some Japanese games. The _APv1 style protection can only prevent a backup CD-R of a game from working on a console that has a 'non-stealth mod-chip' installed_. APv1 style protection can not detect games booted with Tonyhax International on a stock console without a _non-stealth_ mod-chip. 

Quite a few of the many APv1 games have support at this time. Newer updates to International will add support for more APv1 games.

## APv2

Unlike APv1, APv2 detects both soft-mods and non-stealth mod-chips. It is found in some Japanese games, some USA games, and a few PAL games. 

At this point almost all if not every single game with this protection now has a working bypass implemented.

The very early SCPH-3000 Japanese consoles, and all SCPH-1000 Japanese consoles are immune to tripping APv2 as long as they are not containing a 'non-stealth' mod-chip. These consoles will work with every game without a bypass even being needed.

## What Happens When Additional Anti-Piracy Protection Is Triggered

![poporogue japan rev 0 apv1 triggered](images/poporogue-japan-non-stealth-mod-chip-apv1-triggered.png)

![dino crisis usa rev 0 apv2 triggered](images/dino-crisis-usa-rev-0-non-stealth-mod-chip-apv2-triggered.png)

![spyro year of the dragon usa rev 0 apv2 triggered](images/spyro-year-of-the-dragon-usa-rev-0-non-stealth-mod-chip-apv2-triggered.png)

When triggered, the APv1 and APv2 style copy protections will trigger an 'anti-piracy screen of death'. If you encounter an APv2 game that triggers this screen, then the specific game disc is not yet supported (this is a work in progress). In such a case please open an [Anti-Piracy issue](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/issues/new?assignees=&labels=antipiracy&template=antipiracy-issue.md&title=) on the [Tonyhax International Github](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax) to let me know about this specific game which contains APv2 protection. I would eventually like every game that can trigger the anti-piracy copy protection routine when booted via Tonyhax International on a stock console to have a  bypass implemented for 100% compatibility.

## EDC

Some games may contain an EDC-based protection measure. For the affected games, this protection is triggered when you burn the EDC protected PSX CD image with standard CD burning software (like IMGBurn) that forces invalid EDC data to be corrected before writing it the disc. If valid EDC is found where an invalid EDC was expected, then when played on a real PSX will cause the game to trip the protection and lock up.

### Burning With CDRTools

I recommend using the latest CDRTools for burning EDC protected PSX games on Linux. There are pre-built portable releases of a new enough CDRTools for Linux [available](https://alex-free.github.io/cdrtools). Windows versions are available somewhere. The required command syntax for burning EDCRE patched games is this:

`cdrtools -raw16 --speed=x cuefile=yourgame.cue`

Breakdown what each of these arguments to CDRTools do:

`-raw16` specifies to burn the cd image without regenerating EDC/ECC data internally. You can't use the default dao mode anyways because there is some bug in regards to handling the pre-gap between the data and audio tracks when burning with the latest cdrtools currently anyways.

`--speed=x` specifies the burn speed. Replace `x` with a number.

`cuefile=yourgame.cue` specifies that your using a cue file named `yourgame.cue`. Replace `yourgame.cue` with the game's cue file your burning.


### Burning With CDRDAO v1.2.5

CDRDAO v1.2.5 and up supports burning EDC Protected PSX games with CD audio tracks correctly using the `generic-mmc-raw` driver. There are pre-built portable releases of a new enough CDRDAO for Linux [available](https://alex-free.github.io/cdrdao). The required command syntax for burning EDCRE patched games is this:

`cdrdao write --speed x --driver generic-mmc-raw --swap -n --eject yourgame.cue`

Breakdown what each of these arguments to CDRDAO do:

*   `--speed x` argument sets the writing speed. Replace `x` with a number.

*   `--driver generic-mmc-raw` specifies CDRDAO to use the `generic-mmc-raw` driver, which burns the CD image exactly as it is. The default driver used without specifiying these arguments is the **`generic-mmc` driver, which like the other drivers in CDRDAO will auto-regenerate EDC data as the CD image is burned.** This can change the EDC data read from the burned disc later, which some PSX games use as an additional anti-piracy check which if failed will lock up [the game](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#games-with-edc-protection).

*   `--swap` is necessary if the BIN/CUE CD image contains CD audio. Without it, you will get loud static when the CD audio tracks are played as they are by default byte-swapped by CDRDAO if this argument is not specified.

*   `-n` disables the 10 second waiting period before burning.

*   `--eject` will automatically eject the disc immediately after a successful burn.

## LibCrypt

Some PAL PSX games are using a different copy protection scheme known as LibCrypt protection. Similar to EDC protection, LibCrypt protection is triggered when you burn a LibCrypt protected PSX CD image with standard CD burning software, which in most cases changes the SubChannel data when burning such a protected PSX CD image.

LibCrypt protection can be bypassed by ripping the disc image, patching it with the [LibCrypt Patcher](https://alex-free.github.io/libcrypt), and then burning it to a CD-R using any standard burning software.

## Protected Games Support

This is the complete list of all protected games with bypasses for the additional anti-piracy measures that are supported by Tonyhax International. They will all boot and play correctly on both stock, unmodified consoles and consoles with any kind of mod-chip installed (including non-stealth mod-chipped consoles).
